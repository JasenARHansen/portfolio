    This challenge is part of a tutorial track by MyCodeSchool (https://www.youtube.com/mycodeschool) and is
     accompanied by a video lesson.
    Given a pointer to the head of a singly-linked list, print each data value from the reversed list.
    If the given list is empty, do not print anything.
    Example:
        head* refers to the linked list with data values
        1 → 2 → 3 → NULL
    Print the following:
        3
        2
        1
    Function Description:
        Complete the reversePrint function in the editor below.
        reversePrint has the following parameters:
            SinglyLinkedListNode pointer head: a reference to the head of the list
        Prints:
            The data values of each node in the reversed list.
        Input Format:
            The first line of input contains t, the number of test cases.
            The input of each test case is as follows:
                The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the list.
                Each of the next n lines contains a data element for a list node.
    Constraints:
        1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
        1 ≤ list|i| ≤ 1000, where list|i| is the ith element of the list.
    Sample Input:
        3
        5
        16
        12
        4
        2
        5
        3
        7
        3
        9
        5
        5
        1
        18
        3
        13
    Sample Output:
        5
        2
        4
        12
        16
        9
        3
        7
        13
        3
        18

    Explanation:
    There are three test cases.
    There are no blank lines between test case output.
    The first linked list has 5 elements:
        16 → 12 → 4 → 2 → 5 → NULL
    Printing this in reverse order produces:
        5
        2
        4
        12
        16
    The second linked list has 3 elements:
        7 → 3 → 9 → NULL
    Printing this in reverse order produces:
        9
        3
        7
    The third linked list has 5 elements:
        5 → 1 → 18 → 3 → 13 → NULL
    Printing this in reverse order produces:
        13
        3
        18
